# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Madhuri

I'm a Senior Software Developer with over 10 years of experience in building full-stack applications using Java, Spring Boot, and React. I've contributed to scalable enterprise systems at Benevity, JPMorgan Chase, and Oracle Financial Services.

While most of my work has been within private enterprise codebases, the public repositories here showcase some of my earlier work and technical interests.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, JPA, SQL
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Dev Tools**: Git, Docker, Jenkins, IntelliJ, VS Code

### ðŸš€ Open to new opportunities
I'm currently interviewing for senior software roles â€” feel free to send a technical challenge or test project. I'm happy to showcase how I work.
